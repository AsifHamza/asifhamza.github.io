Hey here! My name is Asif Hamza and I like to build things. 
This site is where I talk about my experiments from idea to wastebin or implementation.

My interests include Systems Architecture, Mobile and Web applications and AWS Cloud Infrastructure.
But thats just the technology interests. What really excites me is using that technology stack to see whats possible with Machine Learning, build things in the fields of Finance and Health.
